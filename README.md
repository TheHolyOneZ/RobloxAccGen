##### The gen doesn't work right now; you will get flagged (and asked to complete a CAPTCHA)
#### However, I uploaded the source code to my Discord (via Mega.nz). Join to get it.
##### Discord Server: https://discord.gg/zsGTqgnsmK 

# Just a reminder at the friend request sender u have to put a username in there not the id!




Just start the .EXE file
When it's started u have to select the path where the accounts should be created after you're done u have multiple options u can create (single) custom username accs or multiple accounts with custom usernames u just have to make a TXT file with the usernames u want and select the path in the GUI
it also got a random username selector if u want to just create infinite accs Just press start without using any optional stuff it will open edge and start generating accounts with random usernames (first name, last name, numbers) 

*cough*
Of course only for educational purposes
*cough*

By the way all the code is made with python so if u guys want the source code or smth dont be shy and add my khord: zoryisnotreal
